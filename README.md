# HOMEWORK: Last homework before projects!!!!

![todo](./assets/todo.jpg)

We want to help you stay organized, soooo we are asking you to build a TODO app for yourself ðŸ˜ƒ

Using ALL the materials from the past week (complete animals app, lecture notes, etc) you will build a complete Express application from **SCRATCH** ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

# DO NOT PUT YOUR TODO APP IN THIS REPOSITORY.

**You should put your homework in a new repository. This is because you will need to deploy it.**

## What's been provided for you:

The following user stories:
- User should be able to go to `localhost:3000/todos` and see a list of all tasks
- User should be able to create a to-do item that is added to the database
- User should be able to remove a to-do from the database
- User should be able to update a to-do and see the update reflected

The wireframes [here](./wireframes.md). _Your app should follow these wireframes._

## Strongly recommended!!!!

Add user authentication, so each to-do item belongs to a specific user.

### Bonuses

Try at least one of these bonuses! They are meant to get you thinking about what you'll want to do with your projects. HOWEVER: Tackle these after you have the MVP & authentication done!!

- For the navigation, make the current page appear styled differently. For ex, if you are on the homepage, the "home" link in the navigation is highlighted.
- On the main todos page, create two columns: one for tasks that have yet to be done and one for tasks that have been completed.
- **SUPER BONUS**: Create a "categories" table and a "categories" page that lists all the categories. When you click on a category in the "categories" table, you should be able to see all the todos in that category.
- **SUPER BONUS**: Instead of going to a new page for editing, pop up a modal window instead.
- **SUPER BONUS**: Add some tests!! [Refer to the express module's tests](https://github.com/expressjs/express/tree/master/test) to see how you might go about this. Also, check out the first part of [this tutorial](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/09/10/testing-node-js-with-mocha-and-chai/#.WXtj_NPyvr1) (up to the "hooks" part).

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- You have a working to-do app with database
- Your to-do app is **not in this repository**
- Your to-do app **follows the wireframe**
- Your to-do app **has been deployed to Heroku**
- Your to-do app has been styled
- You have at least **attempted** to add authentication to your to-do app
- You have completed **at least one bonus**

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A **pull request** created on _this repo_.
- A link to your to-do app repository (which should NOT be THIS ONE!!!)
- A link to your **deployed to-do app**
- [A submission on Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/MTI4MTM1MjgyNDYw)
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 10AM ON MONDAY MORNING ðŸš¨
